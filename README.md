# AI/ML - Powered-Financial-Analysis-and-Prediction-System
This repository hosts the Credit Risk Assessment and Decision Support System, a comprehensive solution designed to predict loan default risk and provide actionable insights for financial institutions. The system integrates machine learning and explainable AI to enable accurate, transparent, and data-driven decision-making.
# Key Features-
# 1. Borrower Risk Prediction:
Utilizes XGBoost, a high-performance gradient boosting algorithm, to predict the likelihood of borrower default based on historical and current financial data.

# 2. Explainability with SHAP:
Implements SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide clear feature-level explanations, helping decision-makers understand why a borrower is flagged as high or low risk.

# 3. Sector-Level Trend Analysis:
Incorporates a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model to forecast sectoral trends and analyze the impact of macroeconomic indicators on risk patterns.

# 4. Live Data Simulation:
Enables real-time testing of the system using simulated live data streams, ensuring robustness and reliability in dynamic financial scenarios.

# 5. Interactive Dashboard:
A Power BI dashboard presents key metrics, borrower profiles, risk scores, and sector trends through intuitive visualizations and interactive filters, allowing quick and actionable insights.

# 6. Decision Support:
Combines predictive modeling and explainability to support final credit decisions, helping lenders optimize portfolio management while minimizing risk exposure.
